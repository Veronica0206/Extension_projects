## Part I: Parallel Bilinear Spline Growth Models (PBLSGMs) in the Framework of Individual Measurement Occasions
**Description:** <br>
In this part, we developed two models in unstructured time framework:
- PBLSGMs for estimating fixed knots 
- PBLSGMs for estimating random knots

**Demo:** 
Frequentist Framework:

- [*R* package: *OpenMx*](https://github.com/Veronica0206/Extension_projects/blob/master/OpenMx_demo1.md)
(For OS, R version, and OpenMx version, see the demo)

**Example data:** <br>

## Part II: Extending Mixture of Experts Model to Investigate Heterogeneity of Trajectories
**Description:** <br>
In this part, we extended Mixture-of-Experts Models to the SEM framework with individual measurement occasions:
- Full mixture of experts
- Expert-network mixture of experts
- Gating-network mixture of experts
- Finite mixture model

**Demo:** 
Frequentist Framework:

- [*R* package: *OpenMx*](https://github.com/Veronica0206/Extension_projects/blob/master/OpenMx_demo2.md)
(For OS, R version, and OpenMx version, see the demo)

**Source Code:** <br>
Will upload later.

## Part III: Growth Mixture Model to Investigate Heterogeneity in Nonlinear Joint Development with Individual Measurement Occasions
**Description:** <br>
In this part, we extended Growth Mixture Models to investigate heterogeneity in nonlinear joint development with individual measurement occasions:
- GMM with a PBLSGM (fixed knots) as the within-class model

**Demo:** 
Frequentist Framework:

- [*R* package: *OpenMx*](https://github.com/Veronica0206/Extension_projects/blob/master/OpenMx_demo3.md)
(For OS, R version, and OpenMx version, see the demo)

**Source Code:** <br>
