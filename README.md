## Part I: Parallel Bilinear spline growth models (PBLSGMs) in the framework of individual measurement occasions
**Description:** <br>
In this part, we developed two models in unstructured time framework:
- PBLSGMs for estimating fixed knots 
- PBLSGMs for estimating random knots

**Demo:** 
Frequentist Framework:

- [*R* package: *OpenMx*](https://github.com/Veronica0206/Extension_projects/blob/master/OpenMx_demo1.md)
(For OS, R version, and OpenMx version, see the demo)

**Source Code:** <br>
Will be added later.
